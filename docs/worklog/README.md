# SavePixie Worklog Guide

Create a new file for each completed step using the naming pattern `STEP-<nn>.md` (e.g., `STEP-00.md`). Copy the template below to capture what was delivered, how it was tested, and what comes next. When guiding Codex, explicitly request that it updates the relevant worklog entry once the implementation is complete.

```markdown
# STEP <nn>: <title>
## Goal

## Changes
- 

## SQL
- 

## Testing
- 

## Screens
- 

## NEXT
- 
```

Attach screenshots or GIFs under the **Screens** section by committing them to `docs/worklog/assets/` (create the folder when needed).
