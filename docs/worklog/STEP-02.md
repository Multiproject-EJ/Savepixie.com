# STEP 02: Savings Goals + Deposits
## Goal
Let authenticated savers manage Supabase-backed goals, record deposits, and visualize their progress on the dashboard.

## Changes
- Turned the dashboard into a Supabase-backed goals workspace with summary stats, progress rings, and empty-state guidance.
- Added goal creation and deposit modals wired to Supabase helpers with optimistic updates and friendly validation.
- Documented the Step 2 product spec detailing dashboard structure, modal flows, and API expectations.
